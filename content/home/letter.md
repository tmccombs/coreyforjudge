Dear Neighbor,

I'm running to be your next District Court Judge because I have a sincere commitment to our
community and the rule of law.

My work as a Hearings Examiner and private practice attorney have given me broad experience in
matters before the Court. From family law and civil litigation to issuing of subpoenas and the
enforcement of law, I have the background to be both a fair and knowledgeable judge.

I also have a commitment to this country and community. I served as an officer in the United States
Army. I have volunteered with the Boy Scouts for 18 years, been an active member of my church, small
business owner, and raised 8 wonderful children in this community.

I would like to personallly ask for your confidence and vote. With your help, I'll be a firm, but
fair judge for this community.

Sincerely,

Corey Larson
